    "#     *Atmospheric noise\n",
    "#     *Radioactive decay\n",

    "# b) Pseudo-Random Numbers (PRNGs):\n",

    "# 1. Most Applications Don't Need Perfect Randomness: In many cases, a sequence that appears random is sufficient. \n",
    "#     For example, simulating a coin flip in a game or generating random data for testing purposes doesn't require perfect \n",
    "#     randomness.\n",
    "# 2. Efficiency: PRNGs are computationally efficient and readily available on most computers. They can generate large \n",
    "#     sequences of random-looking numbers quickly.\n",
    "# 3. Control and Repeatability: PRNGs allow for some level of control through the seed value. This can be useful for \n",
